# Fundraising Process

## Context

Use when the user is preparing to raise a venture round: determining how much to raise, building materials, identifying and targeting VCs, managing the process timeline, and closing. This is the primary reference for Process Mode in the advisor pipeline. Covers the full arc from "should I raise now?" through wire transfer.

---

## Is This the Right Time to Raise?

Before determining amount or targeting VCs, confirm the preconditions. Venture capital is appropriate only when:

- You have a business where the unit economics can support venture-scale returns (10x+)
- You have already done the work only founders can do — early customer conversations, initial product validation, co-founder alignment
- You are raising to accelerate something that is already working, not to discover whether it will work
- You accept that taking VC money means committing to a high-growth, liquidity-oriented path

If the business is fundamentally lifestyle-scale, or if you are pre-validation and raising to fund exploration, venture capital is the wrong instrument. Founders who raise before they are ready spend the capital and then raise again in a weaker position.

---

## Determining the Amount

### The Foundational Rule

Raise enough capital to reach your next fundable milestone, plus a 20-30% buffer for things taking longer than expected.

The minimum viable runway: 18 months. The ceiling: 24 months. These are not arbitrary. Under 18 months leaves no margin — you will start your next fundraise at month 12, which means you are perpetually fundraising. Over 24 months typically requires raising too much capital at too high a valuation to justify, and adds dilution without commensurate milestone progress.

Do not target 6-month rounds. Six months is not a runway — it is a landing strip. By the time due diligence and documentation finish, you have 3-4 months of working capital. You will immediately be back in fundraising mode and no longer have the luxury of a competitive process.

Do not target 36-month rounds. Three-year visibility is speculative at the seed and Series A stage. VCs know this. The dilution required to raise 36 months of runway is rarely worth it, and it creates structural disincentives — large rounds without discipline often produce teams that do not tighten when they need to.

### Milestone Framing

Every amount ask should be attached to a specific milestone. The framing structure:

> "We are raising $X to reach Y milestone by month Z. At that milestone, we will have [proof point], which positions us to raise a Series [next] at [scale]."

Concrete examples of qualifying milestones:
- Revenue: "$1.2M ARR with three enterprise logos and a defined sales motion"
- Product: "Live product with 500 active daily users and less than 5% weekly churn"
- Clinical or regulatory: "Phase 2 data readout with enrollment complete"
- Infrastructure: "Unit capable of commercial production at $X cost per unit"

Avoid milestone descriptions that are activity-based rather than outcome-based. "Complete product development" is not a milestone. "Product live with paying customers" is.

### Buffer Calculation

Build the raise target as: (monthly burn rate x target months) x 1.25.

If your projected monthly burn is $150K and you need 18 months of runway, your base capital need is $2.7M. Add 25% buffer: raise $3.4M. Round to the nearest $250K-$500K for clean numbers, biased upward.

The buffer is not waste. It is the difference between choosing to raise the next round from strength at month 18 versus being forced to raise from weakness at month 14.

## Fundraising Materials: The Hierarchy

Different materials are appropriate at different stages of the process. Build all of them before your first outreach.

### Tier 1: Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

The pitch you give in any unplanned encounter. Three elements, in this order:

1. What you do and for whom (one sentence, specific)
2. What traction or validation you have (one sentence, specific)
3. What you are doing now and what you want (one sentence)

Avoid industry jargon, analogies ("we are the Uber of X"), and general market claims. This version is for person-to-person context, not for meetings.

### Tier 2: Executive Summary (1-2 pages)

The full story in compressed form. Should cover all the same ground as a deck in text form. Many VCs read executive summaries before agreeing to meetings — a weak summary often ends the process before it starts.

Required elements: problem, solution, market sizing, business model, traction metrics, team bios with specific relevant credentials, funding ask with use of funds.

Specific threshold on team bios: include credentials that are directly relevant to why this team can win this specific market. "Serial entrepreneur" is not a credential. "Previously ran supply chain at a company operating in the same logistics market" is.

### Tier 3: The Deck (15-20 slides)

The deck is for meetings, not for reading. It is a visual aid to a verbal pitch, not a document that stands alone. A deck that requires reading to understand is a weak deck.

Feld and Mendelson's recommended slide sequence:

1. Cover (company name, tagline, contact, date)
2. Problem (specific, felt, often represented as a customer story)
3. Solution (your product, how it solves the stated problem)
4. Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM with methodology, not just large round numbers)
5. Team (relevant credentials, why you specifically)
6. Business model (how money is made, unit economics if available)
7. Traction (what you have proven, metrics)
8. Competition (2x2 or positioning map, honest)
9. Go-to-market (first 6-12 months channel strategy)
10. Financials (3-year projection, key assumptions visible)
11. Ask (amount, use of funds, milestone unlocked)
12. Appendix (supporting data, customer quotes, technical detail on request)

The traction slide is the most important slide in the deck. If you have no traction to show, that needs to be addressed before fundraising — not disguised with a good design.

### Tier 4: Demo or Prototype

Working product beats live demo beats recorded demo beats wireframes beats description. Each step down reduces conviction meaningfully. If you have a working product, always demo live. If the live demo has reliability issues, fix them before fundraising or record a clean version.

### Tier 5: Business Plan

Traditional narrative business plans are rarely read by VCs. If a VC asks for one, treat it as a signal about their investment style — it may indicate a slow, committee-based process or an investor not calibrated to early-stage companies. Have a more detailed narrative document available if specifically requested, but do not lead with it.

## VC Targeting: 4-Tier Classification

Before reaching out to a single VC, classify every potential investor across these four tiers.

### Tier 1: Strong Leads

Definition: VCs who invest at your stage, in your sector, have available capital in an active fund, and have a pattern of leading rounds — taking board seats, writing the lead term sheet.

These are your primary targets. All of your best meeting slots, best timing, and most focused preparation should go to this tier. Reaching out to 50 Tier 1 VCs who do not invest in your stage is wasted effort that burns time and relationships.

How to identify: check fund vintage, fund size (too large means your check size is noise, too small means they cannot lead your round), recent portfolio company stage and sector, and whether they have a pattern of leading or following.

### Tier 2: Potential Leads

Definition: VCs who might lead your round but need convincing — wrong sector but have made one or two investments adjacent to yours, newer fund building a track record, or a partner at an established firm who is building out a new thesis area.

Run Tier 2 in parallel with Tier 1 but do not give them priority scheduling. They are real options, not backup options, but their conversion probability is lower.

### Tier 3: Long Shots

Definition: VCs who rarely invest in your stage or sector but have done it occasionally. Marquee brand names who invest a level above you but might take interest.

Approach only if Tier 1 and Tier 2 have been fully worked. Time spent on Long Shots at the expense of Tier 1 follow-up is negative expected value.

### Tier 4: Strategics and Followers

Definition: Corporate venture arms (CVCs), family offices, angels, and micro-VCs who do not lead rounds but participate as follow-on capital after a lead is secured.

Do not approach Strategics before you have a lead — they will wait. Strategics are useful for filling out a round after the lead term sheet is in hand. Some CVCs can move independently, but verify this explicitly before treating them as lead candidates.

## Creating Competition: The Single Most Important Process Variable

The leverage in a venture negotiation does not come from negotiating skill. It comes from having multiple interested parties. Everything else is marginal.

Feld and Mendelson are explicit on this: no single tactic improves your outcome across valuation, terms, and speed more than a genuine competitive process.

### How to Create Competition

Compress the timeline aggressively. Schedule all first meetings with Tier 1 VCs within a 2-3 week window, not spread over 3 months. If meetings are spread over a quarter, the investors who met you last month have no urgency — there is no competition they can see or feel.

Practical mechanics:
- Set a target date for first-round meetings
- Open outreach 4-6 weeks before that target
- Do not schedule partner meetings (diligence stage) for any VC until you have had first meetings with all primary targets
- When a VC asks "how is the process going?" respond honestly but with appropriate emphasis: "We have had good conversations with several funds and expect to make a decision in the next 3-4 weeks"

Do not give exclusive access to any one firm before a signed term sheet. Agreeing to exclusive conversations pre-term-sheet means giving away your only negotiating leverage for nothing. The only appropriate exclusivity is the no-shop clause triggered by the signed term sheet itself.

### Signs Competition Is Working

- VCs accelerate their internal process ("can we set up a partner meeting this week instead of next?")
- Questions shift from exploratory to evaluative ("what does your follow-on strategy look like?")
- Unprompted check-ins from VC partners between scheduled meetings
- Explicit questions about timeline: "When do you expect to close?"

### Signs Competition Is Not Working

- VCs ask for more data or more meetings without committing to a timeline
- Partners are difficult to schedule or cancel meetings without rescheduling
- You are being asked to present to "the full partnership" without being told it leads to a term sheet

When competition is not working, the correct response is not to create artificial urgency. Evaluate whether your materials, story, or stage are the issue. Claiming false competing offers is the single most destructive mistake a founder can make — VCs in the same geography talk constantly, and being caught lying ends not just this process but future ones.

## Managing the Funnel: Tracking and Conversion

Build a simple tracking system before your first outreach. Minimum fields: VC firm, partner name, date of first contact, current status, next action, deadline.

### Realistic Conversion Benchmarks

These are approximations from Feld and Mendelson's observed patterns, not guarantees:

- 50 initial approaches → 15 first meetings (30% response rate)
- 15 first meetings → 5 partner meetings (33% advance rate)
- 5 partner meetings → 2-3 term sheets (40-60% advance rate)
- 2-3 term sheets → 1 lead closing (one selected)

This means a competitive process at the Series A level typically requires 30-50 meaningful outreach attempts. Not 10. Not 200. The number is large enough that referral-only approaches often fall short.

### Timeline Expectations

Do not plan for "a few weeks." Plan for 3-6 months from first meeting to money in the bank. The modal timeline breakdown:

- First meetings: weeks 1-4
- Partner meetings and diligence: weeks 4-10
- Term sheet delivery: weeks 10-14
- No-shop, due diligence, documentation: weeks 14-22
- Closing and wire: weeks 22-26

"Fundraising is a full-time job — you cannot do it part-time." One co-founder should own the fundraise almost exclusively during the active period. The other co-founder keeps the company running. Splitting attention evenly between product and fundraising does both poorly.

### Managing Inbound During the Process

If a VC reaches out inbound during your process, treat them as Tier 2 regardless of brand. Schedule them into the existing timeline compression rather than breaking your process to accommodate them. Breaking your timeline for an inbound VC signals that you do not have a competitive process — which is exactly the signal you are trying to avoid.

---

## The Closing Sequence

Once a term sheet is signed:

### Step 1: No-Shop Period Begins (Day 1)

The no-shop clause prevents you from soliciting other term sheets while documentation is in progress. Standard duration: 30-45 days. Maximum you should accept: 60 days.

If you have multiple term sheets, select your lead before signing any of them into a no-shop. Once the no-shop is active, the alternative term sheets expire.

Negotiate the no-shop duration before signing. Over 60 days gives the VC too much time to find reasons to walk — and leaves you off-market for nearly two months with no recourse if they do.

### Step 2: Engage Legal Counsel Immediately

Both sides engage their own legal counsel. Use a lawyer who has closed at least 20 venture financings. A general corporate lawyer who has done real estate and employment work is not appropriate for this transaction — the documents are specialized, and an inexperienced lawyer on your side will slow everything and potentially miss critical terms.

Expect legal fees of $15,000-$40,000 on your side for a seed or Series A. Budget this as part of the cost of the round.

### Step 3: Due Diligence

The VC will conduct a structured diligence process in parallel with document drafting. Prepare a diligence dataroom in advance — do not wait until they ask. Standard diligence items:

- Corporate formation documents (certificate of incorporation, bylaws, all amendments)
- Capitalization table (fully diluted, auditable against corporate documents)
- Founders' agreements and IP assignment documents — every founder must have signed a Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment (PIIA)
- Material contracts: customer agreements, vendor agreements, leases
- Prior financing documents: SAFEs, convertible notes, prior equity rounds
- Financial statements: last 12 months actual, model projections
- Intellectual property: patents, trademarks, evidence that IP belongs to the company and not to a co-founder personally
- Customer references (3-5 customers willing to take calls)
- Key employee equity grants and agreements

Surprises in due diligence kill deals. The most common killers: IP that was developed on a prior employer's time, equity grants that were never properly issued, a cap table that does not match the corporate records. Fix these before fundraising, not during it.

### Step 4: Document Drafting

The standard document set for a priced equity round:

- **Certificate of Incorporation amendment**: Creates the new preferred class and defines its economic terms
- **Stock Purchase Agreement**: Governs the actual purchase and sale of shares, representations and warranties
- **Investor Rights Agreement**: Information rights, registration rights, pro-rata rights for future rounds
- **Voting Agreement**: Board composition, drag-along provisions
- **Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement**: ROFR on secondary transfers, tag-along rights

All five documents are negotiated. The term sheet governs the major economic and control terms; the documents contain substantial additional detail. Do not assume that term sheet agreement means document agreement — re-trading happens. If you agreed on "1x non-participating preferred" in the term sheet, the document should reflect exactly that.

### Step 5: Signing and Closing

All parties sign the full document set. The VC wires the investment amount. Your bank account receives funds. Closing is complete.

### Step 6: Post-Close Tasks

- Board formation: execute written consent establishing the new board structure per the Voting Agreement
- New option pool grants: if the option pool was expanded as part of the round, begin the grant process for new hires
- 409A valuation: commission an independent 409A to establish fair market value of common stock for option pricing — do this within 30 days of closing; grants made before a fresh 409A carry valuation risk

## When to Walk Away from a Term Sheet

Walking away is the correct decision when:

- The VC is seeking effective control without accountability — majority board seats combined with aggressive protective provisions means they can fire you, block strategic decisions, and veto future fundraises without requiring co-investor agreement
- The process has dragged beyond 90 days post-term-sheet without a clear and legitimate cause — delays without explanation are either due diligence problems (they found something they cannot price) or a VC who is unsure and hoping something better appears
- Reference checks reveal a documented pattern of adversarial post-investment behavior: replacing founders without cause, blocking down-round participation to extract terms, or refusing to support companies through difficult periods
- The terms available from this VC are substantially worse than alternatives you can credibly obtain within 30-60 days

Walk-away decisions should be made against explicit criteria defined before negotiation began — not as an emotional reaction in the middle of a difficult session. See negotiation-tactics.md for the full framework on determining and communicating walk-away positions.

## Common Mistakes

**1. No lead pipeline before outreach.** Cold-emailing 200 VCs is not a strategy. It is activity that substitutes for strategy. The result is 200 template rejections and a reputation as unsophisticated. Build targeted lists across the four tiers and approach through warm introductions wherever possible.

**2. Giving exclusive access before a term sheet.** Agreeing to exclusive conversations with one VC — before a signed term sheet — means giving away your only leverage for nothing. Once you are in exclusive conversations, they know you have no competitive pressure. The only appropriate exclusivity is the no-shop clause triggered by a signed term sheet.

**3. Raising too little.** Six months of runway sounds conservative and lean. It is actually the most expensive capital structure: you spend months 1-3 building, spend months 3-6 fundraising again from weakness, and signal to the market that the last round did not go as planned. Raise 18-24 months and mean it.

**4. Not compressing the timeline.** Letting first meetings spread over three months collapses all competition dynamics. The VC who met you in January has no reason to move quickly if you are still taking first meetings in March. Schedule all first meetings within a 2-3 week window. This is the most operationally important step in creating a competitive process.

**5. Underestimating the duration.** Planning for "a few weeks" when the actual clock is 3-6 months means you start fundraising when you have 4 months of runway, which means you are fundraising from desperation. Start the process 9-12 months before you need the money. Begin building VC relationships before you are ready to raise — update them on milestones so that when you do launch a formal process, the first meeting is not a cold introduction.
