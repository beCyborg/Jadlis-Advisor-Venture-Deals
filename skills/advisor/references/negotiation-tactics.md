# Negotiation Tactics

## Context

Use when user is in active negotiation with VCs, preparing for a negotiation session, or trying to handle a specific negotiation situation. Also relevant when user asks how to respond to a specific VC behavior or tactic, or needs a framework for thinking through their negotiating position. Primary reference for Negotiation Mode in the advisor pipeline.

## The Right Framing First

Before any tactic: a venture financing is NOT a zero-sum game.

Both sides should feel they got a fair deal when the negotiation ends. If either party is unhappy after closing, you have a real problem — the financing is only the start of a long relationship, not the end. You will sit in board meetings together for years. The VC will need to support future rounds. A deal that leaves one side bitter poisons everything that follows.

There are only three things that actually matter in any financing negotiation:

1. Achieving a good and fair result
2. Not killing the personal relationship getting there
3. Understanding the deal you are striking

Everything below serves those three goals.

## Pre-Negotiation Protocol

The single biggest negotiation mistake is lack of preparation. Complete every step below before any active negotiation session begins.

### Step 1: Determine Your Walk-Away Point

Write down the terms that would make the deal not worth doing. Do this before the negotiation, not during it. Emotions and momentum cloud judgment in live negotiation — a VC who has invested 40 hours in your due diligence creates pressure that warps real-time decision-making. Decide when calm.

Examples of walk-away thresholds:
- "We will not accept fully participating preferred at any valuation"
- "We will not accept a board where the VC has a majority without a neutral independent director"
- "We will not accept a pre-money valuation below $X after the option pool adjustment"

### Step 2: Know Your BATNA

Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement. The stronger your BATNA, the more freely you can push back on any individual term.

Possible BATNAs to develop before negotiating:
- Competing term sheets from other VCs
- Bootstrapping on current revenue
- Extending runway through cost reduction
- Bridge from existing investors at a valuation floor
- A different round structure (smaller raise, higher price, different investor mix)

When your BATNA is weak, your primary task is to improve it before negotiating — not to compensate with tactics.

### Step 3: Research the VC's Style

- Talk to 3-5 portfolio founders, specifically ones who went through difficult periods with this VC (layoffs, pivot decisions, down rounds). How did the VC behave under pressure?
- Read the partner's public writing — blog posts, Twitter, conference talks. Partners who argue publicly that a term is unimportant will hold to that position in negotiations.
- Understand the fund's position: vintage year, amount deployed, LP pressures, whether they need to demonstrate activity.

### Step 4: Rank Your Priorities

Before any session, rank all open terms. Identify:
- Your top 3 must-haves — terms you will not concede regardless of pressure
- Terms you are willing to concede in exchange for movement on must-haves
- Terms you genuinely do not care about and will agree to immediately

Communicating a genuine concession on a low-priority term earns more goodwill than holding every position equally. Concede visibly on things you do not care about.

### Step 5: Clarify Who Negotiates What

- **CEO negotiates**: Valuation, board composition, option pool size, key economic terms, relationship framing, timeline
- **Lawyer negotiates**: Specific legal language, protective provision wording, registration rights details, indemnification language, technical clause amendments

Do not let lawyers negotiate business terms — they optimize for legal protection, not deal quality or relationship health. Do not let business people negotiate legal language — they miss implications that matter years later.

Your lawyer works for you, not vice versa. If your lawyer is generating heat in negotiations, tell them to tone it down. If the VC's lawyer is aggressive, raise it with the VC partner directly — not their lawyer. Business principals align first, then lawyers paper the agreement.

## The Six Negotiating Styles

VCs and their lawyers fall into recognizable patterns. Identify the pattern early and calibrate accordingly.

### 1. The Bully

**Recognition signals**: Raises voice, dominates the room, uses ultimatums ("This term is non-negotiable"), threatens to walk away when challenged, creates artificial deadlines, pounds the table or applies social pressure.

**Why they do it**: Often not sophisticated about the actual substance. Compensates with aggression.

**Counter-strategies**:
- Stay calm — bullies want an emotional reaction. Deny them one.
- Lower your voice when they raise theirs. Let them exhaust the tactic.
- Never concede anything in direct response to a threat — it teaches them the tactic works.
- When they issue an ultimatum: "I need to think about that. Let me get back to you tomorrow." The pause is almost always tolerated. A VC who walks away over 24 hours was going to be a bad partner anyway.
- Ask clarifying questions rather than arguing: "Help me understand the reasoning behind this position."
- When they say "this is standard" — verify independently with your lawyer and other founders.
- Document every commitment in writing immediately after each conversation.

### 2. The Nice Guy

**Recognition signals**: Unfailingly pleasant, always smiling, says "we're partners." Perpetually positive and perpetually vague. Key decisions get delayed. "Let me get back to you on that" — and then they don't. Months can pass with warm conversations but zero progress.

**Why they do it**: Avoids direct conflict while wearing you out. Some are genuinely indecisive. Others use niceness deliberately.

**Counter-strategies**:
- Be explicit and direct — state your position clearly so there is no room for pleasant ambiguity.
- Don't let warm conversations substitute for documented agreements.
- Set hard deadlines: "I need your answer on the liquidation preference by Friday."
- Add urgency when negotiations stall: "We have other conversations moving forward and need to finalize our decision in the next 10 days."
- Keep a written record after every meeting of what was discussed, what appeared resolved, and what remains open. Share it with them by email.

### 3. The Technocrat

**Recognition signals**: Has a position on every single clause including boilerplate nobody cares about. Cannot prioritize — everything feels equally important. Sends a 50-page markup of a 20-page document. Meetings run three times longer than planned.

**Why they do it**: Some genuinely care about every word. Others use tedium as a weapon — they run you down so that by hour six you agree to something you would have rejected in hour one.

**Counter-strategies**:
- Concede trivial points quickly and visibly to build momentum: "Happy to accept that language on the dividend. Now let's talk about the liquidation preference."
- Maintain absolute focus on your top 3 priorities regardless of their pace.
- Periodically insist on reviewing the overall deal package rather than arguing each clause in isolation.
- Watch for re-trading: technocrats sometimes reopen resolved points when they reach new contentious ones. Call it out directly: "We already closed that point. Let's move forward."

### 4. The Wimp

**Recognition signals**: Indecisive, defers most decisions, constantly needs to "check with my partners." Easy to push on any individual point but commits to nothing. You effectively end up negotiating both sides yourself.

**Why they are tricky**: You can easily overpower them. But a VC who felt steamrolled becomes a resentful, difficult board member. A VC who agreed to terms they felt were unfair will not support you enthusiastically in the hard moments — and there will be hard moments.

**Counter-strategies**:
- Do not exploit the imbalance. Getting an unfairly good deal now will haunt you at the board level for years.
- Make proactive, fair proposals: "Here is what I think is reasonable for both of us" — then explain the reasoning.
- Be patient with their decision-making process but set clear timelines and hold to them.
- Verify they have actual authority to commit. A wimp who lacks authority may have their partnership override any agreements after the fact.

### 5. The Curmudgeon

**Recognition signals**: Nothing is ever satisfactory. Won't yell but radiates constant dissatisfaction. "I've seen this a hundred times." Cynical about your market, projections, team, and terms. Persistent gloom even after points appear settled.

**Why they do it**: Some are experienced and genuinely jaded. Others use negativity as slow pressure to soften your positions over time.

**Counter-strategies**:
- Be patient and upbeat. Treat it like dealing with a skeptical but knowledgeable expert, not a hostile adversary.
- Do not take the negativity personally — it is their default mode, not a specific judgment of your deal.
- Present data, specific numbers, and concrete examples. Curmudgeons respond to evidence far more than to charm or enthusiasm.
- Accept that you will never make them feel good about the deal during the process. You can still get what you need.
- Note: curmudgeons who commit are often very loyal and deeply engaged investors. The skepticism during diligence can be a signal of rigor, not disinterest.

### 6. Smooth, Steady, and Smart

**Recognition signals**: Calm, thoroughly prepared, knows every detail. Can shift between warm and direct as the situation requires. Has clearly done homework on your company, your team, and your prior deals. Makes you feel respected and understood while consistently advancing their position. If you are underprepared, they will outmaneuver you — and you will feel fine about it.

**Why they are the hardest**: Legitimately skilled. Not relying on psychological tactics — relying on preparation and judgment.

**Counter-strategies**:
- Match their preparation level. This is the one style where your prep level is the primary variable.
- Pause before accepting any proposal that sounds very reasonable — evaluate it on the merits, not the delivery. Smooth negotiators make unfavorable terms feel obvious.
- Document everything carefully — they are precise about language and will hold you to yours.
- Mutual respect between two prepared parties can produce genuinely good outcomes. This is often the pairing that produces the best deals.

## Game Theory Fundamentals

### This Is a Multiplay Game

A venture financing is not a one-shot transaction. It is the beginning of a repeated game:
- You will sit in board meetings together for years.
- The VC needs to support your Series B, Series C, and any bridge rounds.
- Both parties have public reputations in a small, highly networked industry.
- Tit-for-tat dynamics apply: bad behavior now creates justified bad behavior later.

This is why winning every point is a poor strategy even when you can. The goal is a deal both sides can live with — and a working relationship that survives the first difficult board meeting.

### Information Asymmetry

VCs see hundreds of deals per year. You negotiate one or two rounds in your company's lifetime. VCs know what terms they gave other portfolio companies; you do not have that data.

Mitigate by: talking to founders who raised recently in your stage and sector, using experienced venture counsel (not a generalist business attorney), and reading primary sources (Feld and Mendelson's book).

### Walk-Away Credibility

Never threaten to walk away unless you are prepared to follow through. If you bluff and they call it, you have lost all credibility for the remainder of this deal and frequently for future deals in the same VC community.

If you are sincere — state your limit clearly, explicitly, and without drama. "We cannot accept participating preferred. If that is a firm requirement, we will need to explore other paths." Then stop talking. If they want this deal, they will return with a revised offer.

---

## Specific Leverage Tactics

### Creating Competition

Multiple competing term sheets compress all terms toward founder-favorable outcomes. Even a weaker competing term sheet — lower valuation, less prominent fund — changes the dynamic substantially.

How to create it:
- Approach all target VCs simultaneously, not sequentially
- Compress timing: all first meetings within a 2-3 week window
- Be transparent but vague: "We're in conversations with several firms and moving quickly"
- Do NOT name competing VCs — they will call each other
- Do NOT fabricate offers — it gets discovered in reference calls and destroys credibility permanently

### Anchoring

State your position on your 2-3 most important terms early and hold those positions firm. Trade lesser terms visibly. Explicit bundling is more effective than silent firmness: "We will accept your pool size if you accept a non-participating preferred with a 1x liquidation preference." Framing a concession and a demand together feels collaborative.

### Controlling Sequence

Never let the other side go through the term sheet point-by-point from top to bottom in real time.

- Listen to all their comments before responding: "Let me hear everything, then we'll respond as a package"
- Address easy items first to build momentum
- Save valuation for last — it requires multiple rounds and benefits from goodwill built elsewhere

### Responding to Artificial Deadlines

"Take it or leave it" and "We need an answer by Friday" are almost always artificial. A VC who has invested 30-40 hours in your deal does not abandon it over a 48-hour pause. Ask why the deadline exists. If the reason is "because we said so" rather than a legitimate fund event (LP meeting, quarter close, commitment period expiration), treat it as a tactic.

---

## Things Not to Do

**Do not present your own term sheet.** Let the VC make the first offer. You might anchor lower than they were planning.

**Do not go point-by-point** if the other side controls the sequence — you will lose the big picture while winning trivia.

**Do not use "that's market" as your only justification.** It is a weak argument. Explain specifically why a term works for your situation and your investors.

**Do not bluff competing offers.** VCs in the same geography network constantly. If caught, you lose all credibility for this deal and often for future deals in that community.

**Do not assume consistent ethical standards.** Not everyone plays by the same rules. Document all agreements in writing immediately after calls. If a VC rolls back a verbal commitment, you need a record.

**Do not let your lawyer run the negotiation.** Lawyers who behave aggressively or unprofessionally reflect on you. You will have a long-term relationship with this VC. Your lawyer will move on to other clients.

---

## Can You Fix a Bad Deal Later?

Yes, through three mechanisms:

1. **Next financing round**: A new lead investor can and often does clean up onerous terms from prior rounds as a condition of leading the new round. Series A investors routinely negotiate away aggressive seed-stage provisions. This is common and expected.

2. **Direct renegotiation**: After demonstrating real progress, sit down with the existing VC and request specific modifications. Frame it as aligning the structure with the current relationship, not as a complaint about the original deal. This works when the relationship is genuinely good.

3. **At acquisition**: Management retention pools in acquisition agreements can rebalance economic outcomes even when the underlying cap table structure is unfavorable. Acquirers have their own incentives to ensure key team members receive adequate compensation.

None of these paths is as good as negotiating well in the first place. But if you accepted a bad deal under desperation and have since proven yourself, the situation is not permanent.
